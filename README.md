## Ideas
- Script or tool (maybe using Python, PowerShell, or low-code workflow) that automates a routine security task such as device setup/enrolment, patch reporting, log collection/alerting, user-access audit.
- Crypto exchange and blockchain network in Python to show wallet security, mining, consensus, and 51% attack behavior.
